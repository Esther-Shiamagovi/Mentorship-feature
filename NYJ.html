        <h2>Born A Crime</h2>
    <p>

Trevor Noah wrote a novel titled Born a Crime. He was born in the colonial period, before apartheid brought about the racial demographic and the separation of South Africans into tribes.  The two main groupings are the Xhosa people and the warrior Zulu people. Because of racial discrimination, this approach led to people's freedom being restricted and their mobility being restricted. In his analysis, Noah looks at the difficult issues of race, identity, family, and religion that marginalized people in today's society must deal with.

I can relate to the novel's idea of identity as being a place where you feel like you belong. People in my county are divided into many ethnic groups, and we recognize them by their ethnicity.

Freedom to choose where to attend a service as  different churches have different practices during services is relevant to todays as there are churches conduct services differently.
Patricia acts in the same way that she tosses Noah out of a moving car, and my mother goes above and beyond to make sure we are safe.
Today, there is prejudice based on ethnic origin because many people are assessed based on assumptions about their ethnic group's way of doing things. This is similar to the novel, when Patricia was subjected to lectures from strange men based on her tribe.

Noahâ€™s family is protective, as the grandmother never allowed him to go out whenever he visited to avoid him being taken away. Today, family members work together in hardships and happiness in order to protect and support each other for growth.
